### Core DevOps Metrics for Incident Tracking and Resolution

1. MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge)
ğŸ‘‰ Definition: The average time taken to acknowledge an incident after it occurs.
ğŸ“Œ Why it matters: Measures responsiveness of the on-call team.

2. MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve or Repair)
ğŸ‘‰ Definition: The average time taken to fully resolve an incident from the moment it is reported.
ğŸ“Œ Why it matters: Indicates how quickly systems are restored to normal.


3. MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)
ğŸ‘‰ Definition: The average time taken to detect or become aware of an incident.
ğŸ“Œ Why it matters: Helps evaluate the effectiveness of monitoring and alerting.

4. MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
ğŸ‘‰ Definition: The average time between one incident (or failure) and the next.
ğŸ“Œ Why it matters: A reliability metric that shows how often things break.

5. MTTI (Mean Time to Investigate)
ğŸ‘‰ Definition: Time spent analyzing the issue after detection and before fixing.
ğŸ“Œ Why it matters: Useful for identifying bottlenecks in the diagnostic phase.

6. MTTF (Mean Time to Failure)
ğŸ‘‰ Definition: Average time a system operates before failing.
ğŸ“Œ Why it matters: Used more in hardware/system design, but occasionally tracked in SRE practices.
