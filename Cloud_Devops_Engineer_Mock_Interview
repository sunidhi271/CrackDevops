- Design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based app deployed on AWS/EKS. What tools would you use and why?
- How do you ensure high availability and disaster recovery in Kubernetes-based deployments?
- How do you manage IAM roles/policies in AWS at scale for least privilege?
- How do you ensure consistency across multi-cluster / multi-account setups in AWS?
- Design a secure multi-tenant EKS cluster for a financial institution. How would you handle isolation, IAM, networking, and compliance checks?

Topics Related to Security:
- What are common security misconfigurations in Kubernetes/AWS you’ve seen and how to remediate them?
- What’s the difference between OPA Gatekeeper and Kyverno? Why did you choose one over the other?
- How do you manage secrets in production securely (compared: Sealed Secrets, Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)?
- How did you integrate Azure AD SSO with Kubernetes workloads?
- How do you enforce compliance in Kubernetes (RBAC, Pod Security, NetworkPolicies, OPA Gatekeeper)?
- How would you design a pipeline that ensures only compliant code/images are deployed (image scanning, IaC scanning, policy checks)?

Topics Related to kubernetes:
- How do you audit a Kubernetes cluster or CI/CD pipeline for compliance?
- How do you standardize Kubernetes deployments for multiple dev teams?
- How do you integrate security checks into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., SonarQube, Trivy, Aqua, Checkov)?
- In your GitOps setup (ArgoCD), how would you prevent non-compliant manifests from being deployed?
- Can you describe a time when a pipeline helped catch a compliance/security issue before production?
- Tell me about a security incident you handled — how did you detect it, and what remediation did you apply?
- How do you ensure audit readiness for logs and monitoring data?
- How would you approach root cause analysis for a major compliance breach in Kubernetes (e.g., unencrypted secrets, public S3 bucket)?
- How do you design a zero-trust access model for developers on Kubernetes clusters?
- How do you secure container images in Harbor and enforce compliance policies?
- What kind of incident did you handle recently where monitoring/alerting helped resolve it quickly?
