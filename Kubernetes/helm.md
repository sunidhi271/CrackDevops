ðŸŽ¯ HELM Concepts

Q: How can you pass custom values to a Helm chart when deploying it?
```
helm template --name 123 --set .Values.key=value
```

Q: How can you use the helm template command to generate the template output of only a specific file (e.g., deployment.yaml) in the Helm chart instead of rendering the entire chart? 
```
helm template my-release ./my-chart --show-only templates/deployment.yaml
```

Q: How would you rollback a Helm release to a previous version but only modify specific resources, leaving others untouched?
```
- helm rollback my-release 2 --dry-run --output-dir ./rollback-manifests
- Then edit the specific resource(e.g, deployment.yaml)
- kubectl apply -f ./rollback-manifests/templates/deployment.yaml
```

Q: What happens if you run helm install with a release name that already exists in the cluster ?
```
Helm will throw an error, Error: cannot re-use a name that is still in use.
To upgrade or make changes on an an existing release, you should use helm upgrade.
```

Q: Can you install the same Helm chart multiple times in the same namespace?
Ans: Yes, but you must use different release names for each install.
```
helm install app1 mychart/  
helm install app2 mychart/
```

Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between helm template and helm install --dry-run --debug?
```
helm template: Renders templates locally without any connection to Kubernetes cluster.
helm install --dry-run --debug: Simulates an install, rendering templates and validating them against the cluster's API (if possible). Better for debugging.
```

Q: How would you rollback a Helm release to a previous version?
```
helm rollback <release> <revision-number>
```
To get revision number,
```
helm history <release>
```

Q: What does Helm do with Secrets or ConfigMaps created in templates during helm uninstall?
```
Helm tracks all Kubernetes resources it creates using labels and annotations, so it automatically deletes them on helm uninstall. But resources created manually or outside of the chart wonâ€™t be deleted.
```

Q: What is the purpose of the _helpers.tpl file in Helm charts?
```
It's used to define template helper functions, like naming conventions, labels, or reusable snippets. You call them using {{ include "template.name" . }}.
```

Q: How can you pass environment variables to a Helm chart at install time?
```
Helm itself doesn't directly support env vars in values.yaml. But you can pass them using the shell:
helm install myapp ./chart --set image.tag=$TAG
```

Q: If you change only values.yaml, will helm diff show changes to the rendered output?
```
Yes. helm diff upgrade - compares the current release against the rendered output of the new values, so changes in values.yaml will reflect in the diff.
```
```
e.g: helm diff upgrade my-release ./my-chart --values my-values.yaml
```

 Q: What if a chart has a requirements.yaml file but no Chart.yaml dependencies block?
```
In Helm 2, requirements.yaml was used for dependencies. In Helm 3, it's deprecated in favor of declaring dependencies directly in Chart.yaml.
```
