Why Terraform is a IaC tool ?
- Because using terraform we are creating infrastructure components like VPC, s3, ec2 etc, using json or yaml templates of terraform, which is like a code, which AWS understands.
- Terraform language is called Hashicorp Templating Language. (HCL Lanugage)
- It uses a concept called API as code internally.It uses APIs of different cloud providerto create infra.
- It converts the HCL code to the cloud's resepctive APIs.

Why to use Terraform if AWS CLI or AWS Cloud formation or Azure resource manager template we can do that ?
- Because with Terraform we can create Infrastructure of any cloud, otherwise, we have to learn separate language for separate clouds. It Provides Muti Cloud support.
