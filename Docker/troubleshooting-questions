Q)  If a container restarts repeatedly after being run, how would you identify the root cause without modifying the Dockerfile ?

Ans: If a container is restarting repeatedly after being run, and I cannot modify the Dockerfile, I would follow a systematic debugging approach using external tools and runtime analysis:
1. Check container logs: docker logs <container_id>
2. Check exit code: docker inspect <container_id> --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}'
- Exit code 0 - sucessful pod creation,
- Exit code 1 -  out-of-memory,
- Exit code 137 - OOM Killed - in this case I will check the resource limits on docker or k8s side. (docker stats <containerId>)
- Exit code 139 - application crashes
3. Check environment variables and configurations 
4. Check Network Dependencies - application depends on external services (DB, API, etc.), ensure network connectivity is working.
5. If container fails after running for sometime, Use an interactive shell - docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh <image>
- check logs of container
- check the permissions of files
- check config files
6. Mount external volume to check internal logs/configuration files - Sometimes, the app may generate internal logs to files. 
I can mount volumes to extract those logs: docker run -v /host/log/dir:/container/log/dir <image>
7. Override entrypoint to run the container for sometime to debug: docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh <image>


Q: What happens when you bind mount a host directory into a container(during build time) where the directory already exists with data? Will the container’s files persist ?
- The host directory takes precedence — Docker will mount the host directory over the container directory.
- The existing data inside the container at that mount path will be hidden (masked), not merged.
- The container’s existing files at that path still exist inside the image, but they are not accessible while the mount is active.
- Its not possible to mount a directory to a container when it is running. Even when we mount a new volume to a deployment, then it will restart the pod.
- Only during the build time it is possible to mount the volume.
